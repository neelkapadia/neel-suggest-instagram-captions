And all at once, summer collapsed into fall
You are never too old to play in the leaves
I still fall for you everyday
There is magic in the night when pumpkins glow by moonlight
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall
Autumn shows us how beautiful it is to let things go
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
Autumn carries more gold it its pocket than all the other seasons
It was a dream that woke up the fall
