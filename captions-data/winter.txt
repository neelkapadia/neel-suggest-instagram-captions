Paradise doesn't have to be tropical
My favorite winter activity is going back inside and putting my pajamas on
Kindness is like snowâ€”it beautifies everything it covers
Children of winter never grow old
The weather is getting colder and colder, which means snow is right around the corner
As far as we're concerned, there's no better way to commemorate the first snow
No snowflake ever falls in the wrong place
Coffee and Christmas music
Cold hands, warm heart
Make it a winter to remember
