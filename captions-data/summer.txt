Summertime is always the best of what might be
Let the summer begin
Summer is all I want
Life is better when youâ€™re under the sun
Can we restart summer
The tans will fade but the memories will last forever
I dream of summers that last forever
Be grateful for good friends, hot sun, and clear water
Dreams are made of sand and sun
Less Monday, more summer, please.
