All I need is some Vitamin Sea
Sea more of the world, one beach at a time
All I need is the salt in my hair and the sand between my toes 
Good times and tan lines
Girls just wanna have SUN
High tide or low tide, Iâ€™ll stay by your side
They say summer bodies are made in the winter
The cure for anything is salt water: sweat, tears, or the sea
In the waves of change, we find our direction
See you on the next wave
